# Panda Ghostwriter

Panda Ghostwriter is a simple AJAX driven theme for the [Panda](https://github.com/T-PWK/panda/) blogging platform released under the MIT License. 

Panda Ghostwriter was built based on [Ghostwriter](https://github.com/roryg/ghostwriter) for [Ghost](https://github.com/TryGhost/Ghost)


### Features

* Clean typography focused design.
* Fully responsive (includes fitvid.js for responsive video embeds).
* AJAX loading for fast, smooth transitions between posts and pages.
* SASS files included.
* Static page support.
* Featured post support.
* A bunch of other bits and bobs.


### Troubleshooting

###### The Browse Posts link isn't working

If you're having trouble with the browse posts link not working make sure you're using the currect URL for your environment in your Ghost config.js file. I.e. if your Ghost site is being served on http://your-site-name.com make sure you use exactly that URL in your config.js file and not for example http://www.your-site-name.com
